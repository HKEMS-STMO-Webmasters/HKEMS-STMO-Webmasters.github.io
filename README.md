### About us:

海口实验中学科技社(Science and Technology Matching Organization)是由海口实验中学（以下简称我校）学生自发组织的、由我校社团联合会，校团委等组织管理的科学技术类学生社团，是我校学子在实践中运用所学知识，探求新知，提升科技创新能力的校内活动平台。

我社历史悠久，底蕴深厚。1995年，我社前身之一 —— 海口实验中学电脑社创立，作为我校最早成立的社团之一，电脑社一经成立便饱受我校学子的欢迎。后于2008年，因同学们对于校园社团文化多样的需求，原电脑社改组成为MIC科研社，拓宽了社团活动范围。2013年，社团文化升级，正式改组为海口实验中学科技社。

自我社成立至今，在各届干部的带领下，在校内外开展了丰富多彩的社团活动。社团坚持不断创新，勇攀高峰的精神，发扬追求知识，追求真理的科学品质，与新时代同向同行，坚持贯彻“在创造实践中成长”的理念，力求让每一个社员都能在良好的氛围下创作出技术含量丰富，创意令人两眼一亮的科技作品。


Science and Technology Matching Organization of Haikou Experimental High School is a science and technology student association voluntarily organized by students of Haikou Experimental High School (hereinafter referred to as our school) and managed by our school's club federation, school youth league committee, and other organizations. It is an internal activity platform for students of our school to apply their knowledge, explore new knowledge, and enhance their technological innovation ability in practice.
Our society has a long history and profound heritage. In 1995, one of the predecessors of our school, the Computer Society of Haikou Experimental Middle School, was founded. As one of the earliest clubs established in our school, the Computer Society was warmly welcomed by our students as soon as it was established. In 2008, due to the diverse needs of students for campus club culture, the original Computer Society was reorganized into MIC Research Society, expanding the scope of club activities. In 2013, the club culture was upgraded and officially reorganized as the Science and Technology Society of Haikou Experimental High School.
Since its establishment, under the leadership of various cadres, we have carried out a variety of club activities both on and off campus. The club adheres to the spirit of continuous innovation and daring to climb new heights, promoting the scientific quality of pursuing knowledge and truth, walking with the new era, and adhering to the concept of "growing through creative practice", striving to enable every member to create technological works with rich technical content and dazzling creativity in a good atmosphere.
